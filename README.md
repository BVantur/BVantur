# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am BlaÅ¾ Vantur, an experienced Android developer of 12 years with some experience with iOS and Flutter development. After KMP came to my radar I started actively observing this technology and trying out different things with it. I am really passionate about Android and even more about KMP as I noticed lately. Check my Kotlin Multiplatform open source library below called [Inspektify](https://github.com/BVantur/inspektify) which is currently supported only for mobile platforms.
